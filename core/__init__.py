"""
Initialization module for the Europa Universalis map components.

This module imports the necessary components for the map and interaction logic, including 
color management, map rendering, user interaction handling, and world data. These components 
are used to display and interact with the Europa Universalis world map, including features 
such as zooming, panning, and switching between different map modes.

Imports:
    - **EUColors**: Manages color schemes for provinces, countries, and other map features.
    - **MapHandler**: Handles user interactions with the map, such as panning and zooming.
    - **MapPainter**: Responsible for rendering the world map with various map modes (e.g., political, region).
    - **MapDisplayer**: Displays the rendered map and updates the UI elements.
    - **EUWorldData**: Stores and manages the world data, including provinces, countries, and regions.
